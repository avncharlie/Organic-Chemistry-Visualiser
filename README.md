# Organic Chemistry Visualiser

> A tool to visualise organic compounds 

OCV (Organic Chemistry Visualiser) is a project that parses basic IUPAC nomenclature and renders the described compound.

## Usage
OCV is a project I wrote to learn about how parsing and lexical analysis works. It should however be used as a visualiser, not as a IUPAC name verifyer. This is as it attempts to be as accurate in parsing but has many limitations (take a look "What OCV can't do" section). 


## Use it
1. Go to the latest release on the [releases page](https://github.com/avncharlie/organicChemistryVisualiser/releases).
2. Download the .exe file for your system. If you're unsure, get the 32 bit version.
3. No installation, double click to run
4. ðŸ§ª ðŸŽ‰

If something isn't working like you think it should, make sure you read through what OCV can and can't do below. If you are still stuck, [create an issue](https://github.com/avncharlie/organicChemistryVisualiser/issues/new).

## What OCV can't do
* Locants cannot be guessed - they have to explicitly stated in every case.
  * e.g. `hexandioic acid` has to be entered as `hexan-1,6-dioic acid`.
  * Some simple cases have been patched - e.g. `ethene` can be entered instead of `eth-1-ene`. Specifically eth/ene/yne and prop/ene/yne names no longer need locants.
* Locants outside a main chain â€“ e.g. `1-hexene` will not parse. `hex-1-ene` should be used instead.
* Nitrogen locants (e.g. `N-methyl`) are not supported.
* Any functional group not supported.
* Take a look at the three "Complex Example" names for examples of complicated nested organic compounds. They give a good overview of OCV's functionality.

## What OCV can do
* Straight chain and cyclical main bases
* The following functional groups (attached after the main chain, e.g. `-ol`, or as a substituent before the main chain, e.g. `hydroxy-`)
  * Alkenes and Alkynes
  * Acetyl groups
  * Fluoro, Chloro, Bromo and Iodo groups
  * Amide groups
  * Carboxylic acid
  * Aldehydes
  * Ketones
  * Alcohols
  * Amines
  * Nitro groups
  * Recursive substituents (substituents with substituents)
* Error messages on impossible / unparseable names, e.g `hex-1,2-diyne`
![Image of an error message on the name (hex-1,2-diyne). The error message is: "carbon at locant 2 overloaded with 6 bonds (carbon valency: 4)"]( https://github.com/avncharlie/organicChemistryVisualiser/blob/master/Documentation/screenshots/error.png?raw=true)

Example of a more complex name (not an actual compound but possible):
`2,4,6-trihexyl-1,3,5-tri(7,5-di(5-cyclobutyl10-carboxy-6-nitrodecan-3,8-diynyl)cyclodecanyl)cyclohexane`

## Technical details
If you're interested, take a look at [howOCVworks.txt](https://github.com/avncharlie/organicChemistryVisualiser/blob/master/Documentation/howOCVworks/howOCVworks.txt). It is a very comprehensive and (hopefully!) easy to read guide on how OCV works. Also take a look at the [structure chart](https://github.com/avncharlie/organicChemistryVisualiser/blob/master/Documentation/howOCVworks/Structure%20Chart.pdf) to see a visual overview of OCV (made with [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)).
